# Prometheus_Engine
A JavaScript engine. This is just the very early stages, much more is to come down the pipeline.

To start a project, download the Prometheus folder and teh boilerplate.html file, put them in a folder and add a "main.js" script.

The documentation is available in [the wiki](https://github.com/Orange-TheGameDev/Prometheus_Engine/wiki).
